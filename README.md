### What is this repository for? ###

This is a personal web comic crawler.
There are some web comics I like and like to save for the archival purposes. 
This is my take to downloading them in batch (instead of repeating right-click, save as, enter, next page...).

*Version 1.0.0*

### TODO ####

For now I have only implemented solutions for CAD and InterroBangStudios. 
They are not fully tested and there are a few bugs that might result in missing an image or two.
